# March for Our Freedom

In the summer of 2020 Gainesville, and cities all over the nation, saw organized protests and efforts to speak out against police brutality and other social issues tied to racism and prejudice.

This page is a graphical hub for the voices of Gainesville's community and the Alligator's coverage of the event.
